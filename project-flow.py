    ~$ heroku run -a lofidelity flask db upgrade
    ~$ heroku run -a lofidelity flask seed all
    ~$ heroku pg:psql postgresql-pointy-72360 --app lofi-test
        \d check tables

BONUS - change album track order drag and drop form
BONUS TODO: add non-existent artist route protection/redirect
BONUS - TODO:  add backend route protection so a logged in user can't update other user's things
    - passing, but bad actor could exploit
BONUS: let artist view page as user (clear session state, then use session thunk to update again)
BONUS: ADD delete to album page with redirect to artist page
BONUS: TODO: artist and album 404 pages
BONUS: TODO: release year custom message - really made in that year " i dont think records existed back then"
BONUS: TODO: uuid in url instead of resourceIds

Unhide/Un-change in Future:
    - Discover Search Bar and notification bell in Nav
    - Extra inner navbar links (merch and community)
    - Forgot Password? on login page
    - change back color of terms of use on signup page
    - add price back in

REMINDER: EXTENSIVE QA of ROUTES
REMINDER: Ensure all errors visible to user make sense
REMINDER: NEED TO RE-MIGRATE PRODUCTION!


Project Note: Scalability and eager loading:
    -eager loading entire database is not scalable
    -better to add fetch requests to each page
    -add loading page to routes -individual thunk requests to db for each page
